# Taglow Participant Draft Cache

Use this skill for client-side draft autosave and restore. The MVP explicitly does not store drafts on the server.

## Read first

- PRD sections: `4.2 Restore Flow`, `19. Frontend Draft Save`, `20. Review`, `24. Validation`.
- TDD sections: `3.4 Draft Cache`, `12. Draft Design`, `18. Error Handling`, `19. Test Strategy`.

## Canonical key

The PRD and TDD use slightly different separators:

- PRD: `taglow_survey_draft:{survey_id}:{participant_user_id}`
- TDD: `taglow-survey-draft:{surveyId}:{participantUserId}`

Choose one canonical key in `buildDraftKey` and use it everywhere. Prefer the TDD hyphenated key for new code. If existing users may already have underscore keys, add a tiny migration read path and remove it after successful save.

```ts
export function buildDraftKey(args: {
  surveyId: string;
  participantUserId: string;
}): string {
  return `taglow-survey-draft:${args.surveyId}:${args.participantUserId}`;
}
```

## Storage contract

```ts
export interface DraftStorage {
  loadDraft(key: string): Promise<SurveyDraft | null>;
  saveDraft(key: string, draft: SurveyDraft): Promise<void>;
  removeDraft(key: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

Start with localStorage. Add IndexedDB fallback only when quota or payload size makes localStorage unreliable.

## Draft shape

```ts
export type SurveyDraft = Readonly<{
  surveyId: string;
  participantUserId: string;
  locale: Locale;
  currentSectionId?: string;
  answersByQuestionId: Record<string, AnswerDraft>;
  updatedAt: string;
  schemaVersion: number;
}>;
```

Include profile answers and image tag points through the same answer map instead of maintaining parallel stores.

## Autosave policy

- Save 500ms after answer changes.
- Save immediately on section navigation.
- Save selected locale and current section.
- Show "saved/saving/restore available" status only when it helps confidence.
- On submit success, remove the draft.
- On submit failure, keep the draft and show retry.
- On parse failure, ignore the draft and let the participant start fresh with a clear notice.
- On schemaVersion mismatch, ask before restoring or migrate only when deterministic.
- On quota failure, fall back to IndexedDB or show that temporary save failed while allowing final submit.

## Restore flow

Restore only after the user identity is known, because drafts are keyed by `surveyId + participantUserId`.

1. User reopens same survey in same browser.
2. Auth session is available and domain is valid.
3. Load draft for the exact survey/user key.
4. Show restore banner/modal.
5. If continue, hydrate locale, section, and answers.
6. If restart, remove or supersede old draft.

## Tests to add

- `buildDraftKey` is stable.
- save/load/remove round trip.
- 500ms debounce writes after answer changes.
- section navigation forces immediate save.
- corrupted JSON returns null and does not throw into UI.
- submit success removes draft; submit failure keeps it.
- draft is separated across survey ids and participant user ids.
