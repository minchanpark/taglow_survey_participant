description: Create, inspect, and merge the Team-Newdawn/taglow_survey_participant pull request from dev to main for production release while keeping origin/minchanpark as the local default remote. Use when the user asks to release Newdawn main, open a dev-to-main PR, merge dev into main, deploy production, or finish the Newdawn release after dev has been pushed.

# Taglow Newdawn Main Release

Use this skill to promote `Team-Newdawn/taglow_survey_participant` from `dev` to `main` through a pull request. This is the production release step after `$taglow-deploy-newdawn-dev`.

## Invariants

- Keep `origin` pointing at `https://github.com/minchanpark/taglow_survey_participant.git`.
- Keep Team-Newdawn in a separate remote named `newdawn-participant`.
- Treat `newdawn-participant/main` as production.
- Never push directly to `newdawn-participant/main`.
- Merge only through a GitHub PR from `dev` to `main`.
- Do not change local branch upstreams or VSCode-facing Git defaults.
- Do not force-push or bypass branch protection.

## Preflight

Verify tools, auth, remotes, and repository state:

```bash
gh --version
gh auth status
git remote -v
git remote get-url origin
git remote get-url newdawn-participant || git remote add newdawn-participant https://github.com/Team-Newdawn/taglow_survey_participant.git
gh repo view Team-Newdawn/taglow_survey_participant --json defaultBranchRef,nameWithOwner,url
```

Stop if:

- `origin` is not `https://github.com/minchanpark/taglow_survey_participant.git`.
- `newdawn-participant` points anywhere other than `https://github.com/Team-Newdawn/taglow_survey_participant.git`.
- `gh auth status` is not authenticated.
- The default branch is not `main`.

## Inspect Diff

Fetch the release branches and inspect the remote-only diff:

```bash
git fetch newdawn-participant main dev
git log --oneline --decorate --left-right --graph newdawn-participant/main...newdawn-participant/dev
git diff --stat newdawn-participant/main...newdawn-participant/dev
```

If there are no commits on `dev` ahead of `main`, report that there is nothing to release and stop.

If `main` has commits that are not in `dev`, stop and explain the divergence before opening or merging a PR.

## Create Or Reuse PR

Check for an existing open PR:

```bash
gh pr list \
  --repo Team-Newdawn/taglow_survey_participant \
  --base main \
  --head dev \
  --state open \
  --json number,title,url,mergeStateStatus,isDraft
```

If an open PR exists, reuse it. If not, create one:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --repo Team-Newdawn/taglow_survey_participant \
  --base main \
  --head dev \
  --title "Release participant dev to main" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Promote the current Team-Newdawn dev branch to main.

## Validation
- Confirmed dev/main diff before release.
- Confirmed branch protection requires PR flow.
EOF
)"
```

After creation, fetch the PR details:

```bash
gh pr view <number-or-url> \
  --repo Team-Newdawn/taglow_survey_participant \
  --json number,title,url,mergeStateStatus,isDraft,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup
```

## Merge

Merge only when the user explicitly asked to merge/release, not when they only asked to open a PR.

Before merging:

- Ensure the PR is not draft.
- Ensure `mergeStateStatus` is not `DIRTY`, `BLOCKED`, or `UNKNOWN`.
- If status checks exist, ensure required checks are passing.
- If GitHub reports branch protection blockers, stop and report them.

Merge with squash by default:

```bash
gh pr merge <number-or-url> \
  --repo Team-Newdawn/taglow_survey_participant \
  --squash \
  --delete-branch=false
```

Keep `dev` after merge because it is the ongoing deployment branch.

## Verify

After merge:

```bash
git fetch newdawn-participant main dev
git ls-remote --heads newdawn-participant dev main
gh pr view <number-or-url> --repo Team-Newdawn/taglow_survey_participant --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit,url
git status --short --branch
```

Local status should still show the user's local branch/upstream connected to `origin`, not `newdawn-participant`.

## Final Response

Summarize:

- PR URL and final state
- merge method used, if merged
- `newdawn-participant/main` commit after release
- `newdawn-participant/dev` commit after release
- local branch/upstream
- any blockers or checks that prevented merge
